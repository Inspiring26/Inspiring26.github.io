一致会在网上断断续续看到GitHub Pages的空间和流量限制，现在GitHub Pages官网找到具体内容。
原文：
```
Usage limits
GitHub Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:

GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB. For more information, see "What is my disk quota?"

Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.

GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.

GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.

If your site exceeds these usage quotas, we may not be able to serve your site, or you may receive a polite email from GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support suggesting strategies for reducing your site's impact on our servers, including putting a third-party content distribution network (CDN) in front of your site, making use of other GitHub features such as releases, or moving to a different hosting service that might better fit your needs.
```
大意：
```javascript
1.GitHub Pages的源文件仓库容量限制为1G
2.GitHub Pages站点大小不能超过1G
3.每个月的带宽为100G

```
***4.每小时只能更新10次***
